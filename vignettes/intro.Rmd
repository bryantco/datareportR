# Rendering the data report

**datareportR** consists of a small but powerful function, render_data_report(), which takes input data and outputs a "data report" as a pdf or HTML document. The generated report allows an analyst to:

1. **View** summary statistics on the entire dataset, such as the mean and quartiles of numeric variables, and number of unique values for categorical variables.

2. **Compare** the data with an old version and to see a printout of differences.

Both of these functions are explained in more detail below.

## Viewing summary statistics

datareportR can generate a view of your data that summarizes numerical and categorical columns (e.g., quantiles, mean, and standard deviation for numeric columns and category frequency for categorical columns), as well as presenting key metadata associated with the dataset, such as number of rows, number of columns, and number of numeric/categorical columns. Under the hood, it uses the powerful `skim::skimr()` function.

A sample call on the `iris` dataset is as follows and renders the following output:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
iris = datasets::iris
render_data_report(df_input = iris, save_report_dir = getwd())
```
