# Rendering the data report

**datareportR** consists of a small but powerful function, render_data_report(), which takes input data and outputs a "data report" as a pdf or HTML document. The generated report allows an analyst to:

1. **View** summary statistics on the entire dataset, such as the mean and quartiles of numeric variables, and number of unique values for categorical variables.

2. **Compare** the data with an old version and to see a printout of differences.

Both of these functions are explained in more detail below.
