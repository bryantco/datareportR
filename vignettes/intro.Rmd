# Rendering the data report

**datareportR** consists of a small but powerful function, render_data_report(), which takes input data and outputs a "data report" as a pdf or HTML document. The generated report allows an analyst to:

1. **View** summary statistics on the entire dataset, such as the mean and quartiles of numeric variables, and number of unique values for categorical variables.

2. **Compare** the data with an old version and to see a printout of differences.

Both of these functions are explained in more detail below.

## Viewing summary statistics

datareportR can generate a view of your data that summarizes numerical and categorical columns (e.g., quantiles, mean, and standard deviation for numeric columns and category frequency for categorical columns), as well as presenting key metadata associated with the dataset, such as number of rows, number of columns, and number of numeric/categorical columns. Under the hood, it uses the powerful `skim::skimr()` function.

A sample call on the `iris` dataset is as follows and renders the following output:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
iris = datasets::iris
render_data_report(df_input = iris, save_report_dir = tempdir())
```

## Comparing the data

datareportR also allows you to compare an input dataset with another dataset and to 
inspect the differences. This provides you a readout of (a) columns with differing values, along
with the number of differing values, and (b) the first 10 rows of differences for each column.Under the hood, this uses the `diffdf::diffdf()` function.

Below is a sample call on the `iris` dataset and comparing it to a permuted version:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(12345)

iris = datasets::iris
iris_permuted = iris

# Randomly switch the order of the Species column
iris_permuted$Species <- sample(iris$Species)

render_data_report(df_input = iris, df_input_old = iris_permuted, save_report_dir = tempdir())
```
