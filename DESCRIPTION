Description: This package creates an RMarkdown data report in HTML with two components: 
   a summary of an input dataset using the `skim` function from the `skimr` package, 
   and a diff of the dataset using the `diffdf` function from the `diffdf` package. 
   The package aims to be as customizable as possible, with options including 
   but not limited to allowing the user to save the HTML or RMarkdown report to 
   disk and which report components to include.
